# Web-Calculator-MDG-Space
This is a web calculator which has the functionality and ability to do basic and tough level mathematic calculations in a matter of seconds.
It works like any other basic calculator which you have seen and it also displays the history .
I have taken the design and colour combinations from an outside resource in youtube.
I've built the entire html code, javascript code and majority of the css code by myself 
I have taken help while writing the css code but i know all the functionalities and how does it work.
The entire functionality of this calcultor is based on my logic and implementation.

#Instructions before cloning and using:

index.html is the file which contains the html code
styles.css is the file which contains the styling for the calculator
script.js is the file which is responsible for the functionality of the calculator.
The clear button in the calculator is used to clear history.
If you refresh the page or make any changes in the code, the display will be set back to default and history will be empty again.
