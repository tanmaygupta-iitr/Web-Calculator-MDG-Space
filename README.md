# Web-Calculator-MDG-Space
This is a web calculator which has the functionality and ability to do basic and tough level mathematic calculations in a matter of seconds.<br>
It works like any other basic calculator which you have seen and it also displays the history .<br>
I have taken the design and colour combinations from an outside resource in youtube.<br>
I've built the entire html code, javascript code and majority of the css code by myself.<br>
I have taken help while writing the css code but i know all the functionalities and how does it work.<br>
The entire functionality of this calcultor is based on my logic and implementation.<br>
<br>
#Instructions before cloning and using:

index.html is the file which contains the html code.<br>
styles.css is the file which contains the styling for the calculator<br>
script.js is the file which is responsible for the functionality of the calculator.<br>
The clear button in the calculator is used to clear history.<br>
If you refresh the page or make any changes in the code, the display will be set back to default and history will be empty again.<br>
